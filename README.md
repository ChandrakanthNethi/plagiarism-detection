# Plagiarism Detection
## Using AWS SageMaker
The notebook and Python files provided in this repository, result in a plagiarism detection model.

## Setup Instructions
The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform. The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a managed notebook instance using SageMaker, from which the notebooks can be completed and run.

### Log in to the AWS console and create a notebook instance
Log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and go to the SageMaker dashboard. Click on 'Create notebook instance'.

- The notebook name can be anything and using ml.t2.medium is a good idea as it is covered under the free tier.
- For the role, creating a new role works fine. Using the default options is also okay.
- It's important to note that you need the notebook instance to have access to S3 resources, which it does by default. In particular, any S3 bucket or object, with â€œsagemaker" in the name, is available to the notebook.
- Use the option to git clone the project repository into the notebook instance by pasting `https://github.com/ChandrakanthNethi/plagiarism-detection.git`
