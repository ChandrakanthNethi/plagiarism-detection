# Plagiarism Detection
## Using AWS SageMaker
This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a plagiarism detector using AWS SageMaker.

## Project Overview
In this project, we build a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.

This project will be broken down into three main notebooks:

**Notebook 1: Data Exploration**
* Load in the corpus of plagiarism text data.
* Explore the existing data features and the data distribution.

**Notebook 2: Feature Engineering**
* Clean and pre-process the text data.
* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
* Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

**Notebook 3: Train and Deploy the Model in SageMaker**
* Upload train/test feature data to S3.
* Define a binary classification model and a training script.
* Train the model and deploy it using SageMaker.
* Evaluate the deployed classifier.

## Setup Instructions
The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform. The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a managed notebook instance using SageMaker, from which the notebooks can be completed and run.

### Log in to the AWS console and create a notebook instance
Log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and go to the SageMaker dashboard. Click on 'Create notebook instance'.

- The notebook name can be anything and using ml.t2.medium is a good idea as it is covered under the free tier.
- For the role, creating a new role works fine. Using the default options is also okay.
- It's important to note that you need the notebook instance to have access to S3 resources, which it does by default. In particular, any S3 bucket or object, with â€œsagemaker" in the name, is available to the notebook.
- Use the option to git clone the project repository into the notebook instance by pasting `https://github.com/ChandrakanthNethi/plagiarism-detection.git`
